# PvZ AI Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Peashooter Placement in All Rows
- **Problem**: AI could only place peashooters in rows 1, 2, 3 (middle rows)
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed `OFFENSE_ROWS = [1, 2, 3]` to `OFFENSE_ROWS = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` in config.py
  - Updated peashooter counting logic to include all rows in strategy.py
  - Modified sunflower expansion logic to check all rows

### 2. Wall-nut Placement Strategy
- **Problem**: AI placed wall-nuts in neighboring cells instead of protecting peashooters
- **Solution**: 
  - Completely rewrote `_plan_defense()` method in strategy.py
  - Now places wall-nuts one cell in front of peashooters to protect them
  - Only triggers when zombies are approaching rows with peashooters

### 3. Reduced AI Delays
- **Problem**: AI was too slow in responding
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced `LOOP_DELAY` from 0.5s to 0.2s in config.py
  - Reduced `CLICK_DELAY` from 0.15s to 0.1s in config.py
  - Reduced sun collection check interval from 2.0s to 1.0s in main.py

### 4. Smooth Cursor Movement Feature
- **New Feature**: Added gamer-style smooth cursor movement
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `smooth_cursor` toggle flag to GameController
  - Implemented smooth movement with distance-based duration scaling
  - Added [G] key toggle in main.py
  - Updated all click methods to support smooth movement
  - Added status display for smooth cursor mode

### 5. Sunflower Placement Debugging
- **Problem**: AI only placing 2 sunflowers instead of 3
- **Solution**:
  - Added debug messages to track sunflower planting
  - Enhanced cell empty check with debugging for sunflower column
  - Added logging to identify placement issues

## Controls Added
- **[G]** - Toggle smooth cursor mode (gamer mode)

## Technical Improvements
- Better error handling for smooth movement (fallback if tween functions unavailable)
- Enhanced debugging output for troubleshooting
- More responsive AI with reduced delays
- Smarter defensive placement strategy

## Files Modified
1. `config.py` - Updated timing and row configurations
2. `strategy.py` - Improved defense logic and peashooter counting
3. `game_controller.py` - Added smooth cursor movement features
4. `main.py` - Added smooth cursor toggle and reduced delays

All changes maintain backward compatibility and existing functionality while adding the requested improvements.
